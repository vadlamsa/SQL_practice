e.managerid = m.empid;

2) Q2 Can you get employee details whose department id is not valid or department id not present in department table?

5)How can you delete duplicate records?

delete * from emp where empid in(select *,count(*) from emp group by empid having count(*) > 1);

delete * from emp where empid in (select empid , rownumber() over (order by empid) as rownum from emp)E
where E.rownum > 1;

6) Find the second highest salary.  

select max(salary) from emp where empid not in (select max(salary) from emp);

7) Now, can you find 3rd, 5th or 6th i.e. N'th highest Salary?

select * from emp rank () over (order by salary desc) as ranknum where ranknum > n-1;

13)Get 5 Employees from every Department getting highest salary (EmpID, DeptID, Salary)

select empname , rank() over (partition by dept_id order by salary desc) as ranknum where ranknum <6;

14)  For these 2 tables: Product(ProductID, ProductName), Sales(SalesOrderID, ProductID, SaleDate)
- Get the list of Products that were sold last year.
- Get the list of Products that were NOT sold last year.
select productname,productid from product join sales on product.productid = sales.productid
where saledate > (current_date - interval '1 year');

15) Can you write an SQL query to show Employee (names) who have a bigger salary than their manager.

select name,salary from emp e join emp m on e.mngid = m.empid where e.salary > m.salary;

16) Write an SQL query to find Employees who have the biggest salary in their Department?

select max(salary),empname group by dept_id;

17) Write an SQL query to list Departments that have less than 3 people in it?

select dept_id, count(emp_id) over (partition by dept_id) as counter from departments where counter < 3;

18)Write an SQL query to show all Departments along with the number of people there?

select depname ,count(emp_id) over(partition by dept_id) as counts from departments;

19) Can you write an SQL query to show all Employees that don't have a manager in the same department?

select empname from emp e join emp m on e.mng_id = m.emp_id where e.dept_id != m.dept_id;

20) List of employees who are not managers

select empname from employee where emp_id is not in (select manager_id from employee and manager_id is not null);
